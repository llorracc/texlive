	Abstract = {Between 1980 and the early 1990s the variability of labor earnings growth rates across the prime-age working population fell significantly. This decline and timing are consistent with other macro and micro observations about growth variability that are collectively referred to as the \&quot;Great Moderation.\&quot; The variability of earnings growth is negatively correlated with age at any point in time, and the U.S. working age population got older during this period because the Baby Boom was aging. However, the decrease in variability was roughly uniform across all age groups, so population aging is not the source of the overall decline. The variance of log changes also declined at multi-year frequencies in such a way as to suggest that both permanent and transitory components of earnings shocks became more moderate. A simple identification strategy for separating age and cohort effects shows a very intuitive pattern of permanent and transitory shocks over the life cycle, and confirms that a shift over time in the stochastic process occurred even after controlling for age effects.},

	Abstract = {Using questions expressly added to the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we estimate the change in consumption expenditures caused by the 2001 federal income tax rebates and test the permanent income hypothesis. We exploit the unique, randomized timing of rebate receipt across households. Households spent 20 to 40 percent of their rebates on nondurable goods during the three-month period in which their rebates arrived, and roughly two-thirds of their rebates cumulatively during this period and the subsequent three-month period. The implied effects on aggregate consumption demand are substantial. Consistent with liquidity constraints, responses are larger for households with low liquid wealth or low income.

	preferences. Over a 17-month period, we elicited risk preferences
	from subjects chosen to be representative of the adult Danish population.
	During this period we revisited many of these subjects and repeated
	a risk aversion elicitation task. We find some variation in risk
	attitudes over time, but we do not detect a general tendency for
	risk attitudes to increase or decrease over a 17-month span. The
	results also suggest that risk preferences are state contingent with
	respect to personal finances.},

	Abstract = {There is abundant evidence, some of it reviewed in this paper, that
	personality traits are substantially influenced by the genes. Much
	remains to be understood about how and why this is the case. We argue
	that placing the behavior genetics of personality in the context
	of epidemiology, evolutionary psychology, and neighboring psychological
	domains such as interests and attitudes should help lead to new insights.
	We suggest that important methodological advances, such as measuring
	traits from multiple viewpoints, using large samples, and analyzing
	data by modern multivariate techniques, have already led to major
	changes in our view of such perennial puzzles as the role of ``unshared
	environment'' in personality. In the long run, but not yet, approaches
	via molecular genetics and brain physiology may also make decisive
	contributions to understanding the heritability of personality traits.
	We conclude that the behavior genetics of personality is alive and
	flourishing but that there remains ample scope for new growth and
	that much social science research is seriously compromised if it
	does not incorporate genetic variation in its explanatory models.},

	permanent income is smoother than measured income. This paper considers
	the evidence for the contrary position, that permanent income is
	in fact less smooth than measured income, so that the smoothness
	of consumption cannot be straightforwardly explained by permanent
	income theory. The paper argues that in postwar U.S. quarterly data,
	consumption is smooth because it responds with a lag to changes in
	income.},

	Abstract = {We examine whether the behavior of current account balances changed
	in the years preceding the global crisis of 2008-09, and assess the
	prospects for global imbalances in the post-crisis period. Changes
	in the budget balance are an important factor affecting current account
	balances for deficit countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. The
	effect of the ``saving glut variables'' on current account balances
	has been relatively stable for emerging market countries, suggesting
	that those factors cannot explain the bulk of their recent current
	account movements. We also find the 2006-08 period to constitute
	a structural break for emerging market countries, and to a lesser
	extent, for industrialized countries. We attribute the anomalous
	behavior of pre-crisis current account balances to stock market performance
	and real housing appreciation; fiscal procyclicality and the stance
	of monetary policy do not matter as much. Household leverage also
	appears to explain some of the standard model's prediction errors.
	Looking forward, U.S., fiscal consolidation alone cannot induce significant
	deficit reduction. For China, financial development might help shrink
	its current account surplus, but only when it is coupled with financial
	liberalization. These findings suggest that unless countries implement
	substantially more policy change, global imbalances are unlikely
	to disappear.},

	behavior, we find that an individual's savings propensity is governed
	by both genetic predispositions, social transmission from parents
	to their children, and gene-environment interplay where certain environments
	moderate genetic influences. Genetic variation explains about 35
	percent of the variation in savings rates across individuals, and
	this genetic effect is stronger in less constraining, high socioeconomic
	status environments. Parent-child transmission influences savings
	for young individuals and those who grew up in a family environment
	with less competition for parental resources. Individual-specific
	life experiences is a very important explanation for behavior in
	the savings domain, and strongest in urban communities. In a world
	progressing rapidly towards individual retirement savings autonomy,
	understanding the origins of individuals' savings behavior are of
	key importance to economists as well as policy makers.},

	relationships in individual countries agree qualitatively with predictions
	of the environmental Kuznets curve. The shapes of these relationships
	are determined non-parametrically for individual countries using
	recently available data on air pollution concentrations. For smoke
	and particulates, the shapes of within-country, pollution-income
	patterns do not agree with the EKC hypothesis more often than chance
	would dictate. For SO2, which generally exhibits EKC-consistent pollution-income
	relationships among wealthier countries, the observed patterns are
	also consistent with a simpler hypothesis.},

	Year = {1991},
	Abstract = {The paper uses a previously unexploited data set -- the Michigan Survey
	of Consumer Finances -- to ask whether the finding that consumption
	tracks current income more closely than is consistent with the permanent
	income hypothesis can be attributed solely or partially to borrowing
	constraints. Using household data on income and asset stocks, the
	paper studies the saving side of the consumption/saving decision,
	and thus provides inferences on a comprehensive concept of consumption.
	To limit the influence of outliers, the paper uses a robust instrumental
	variables estimator, and argues that achieving robustness with respect
	to leverage points is actually simpler, both conceptually and computationally,
	in an instrumental variables context than in the OLS context. The
	results indicate that households do use asset stocks to smooth their
	consumption, although this smoothing is far from complete. However,
	there is no evidence that the excess sensitivity of consumption to
	current income is caused by borrowing constraints. Compared to the
	conventional results, the robust instrumental variables estimates
	are more stable across different subsamples, more consistent with
	the theoretical specification of the model, and indicate that some
	of the most striking findings in the conventional results were attributable
	to a single, highly unusual observation.},

	develops a measure of relative risk tolerance using responses tohypothetical

	shows how to construct a cardinal proxy for the risk tolerance of
	each survey respondent. The article also shows how to accountfor

	regression estimates despite the measurement error. The risktolerance
	proxy is shown to explain differences in asset allocation across

	we show that variants of two genes that regulate dopamine and serotonin
	neurotransmission and have been previously linked to emotional behavior,
	anxiety and addiction (5-HTTLPR and DRD4) are significant determinants
	of risk taking in investment decisions. We find that the 5-HTTLPR
	{\it s/s} allele carriers take 28\% less risk than those carrying
	the {\it s/l} or {\it l/l} alleles of the gene. DRD4 7-repeat allele
	carriers take 25\% more risk than individuals without the 7-repeat
	allele. These findings contribute to the emerging literature on the
	genetic determinants of economic behavior.},

	Abstract = {This paper is an empirical investigation of the behavioral life-cycle
	savings model. This model posits that self-control problems causes
	individuals to depart substantially from rational behavior. I show
	that this model can explain how the consumption of individuals at
	or near retirement vary with changes in different types of financial
	assets. Specifically, consumption spending is sensitive to changes
	in income and in liquid assets, but not very sensitive to changes
	in the value of other types of assets such as houses and social security
	(even though the value of non-liquid assets is relatively large for
	most of the households in the sample). In general, the evidence presented
	here favors the Behavioral Life-Cycle Model over the conventional
	life-cycle model even when liquidity constraints are introduced.}}

	Abstract = {A key rationale for fiscal stimulus is to boost consumption when aggregate
	demand is perceived to be inefficiently low. We examine the ability
	of the government to increase consumption by evaluating the impact
	of the 2009 ``Cash for Clunkers'' program on short and medium run
	auto purchases. Our empirical strategy exploits variation across
	U.S. cities in ex-ante exposure to the program as measured by the
	number of ``clunkers'' in the city as of the summer of 2008. We find
	that the program induced the purchase of an additional 360,000 cars
	in July and August of 2009. However, almost all of the additional
	purchases under the program were pulled forward from the very near
	future; the effect of the program on auto purchases is almost completely
	reversed by as early as March 2010 -- only seven months after the
	program ended. The effect of the program on auto purchases was significantly
	more short-lived than previously suggested. We also find no evidence
	of an effect on employment, house prices, or household default rates
	in cities with higher exposure to the program.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines the hypothesis that the persistence of low spatial
	and marital mobility in rural India, despite increased growth rates
	and rising inequality in recent years, is due to the existence of
	sub-caste networks that provide mutual insurance to their members.
	Unique panel data providing information on income, assets, gifts,
	loans, consumption, marriage, and migration are used to link caste
	networks to household and aggregate mobility. Our key finding, consistent
	with the hypothesis that local risk-sharing networks restrict mobility,
	is that among households with the same (permanent) income, those
	in higher-income caste networks are more likely to participate in
	caste-based insurance arrangements and are less likely to both out-marry
	and out-migrate. At the aggregate level, the networks appear to have
	coped successfully with the rising inequality within sub-castes that
	accompanied the Green Revolution. The results suggest that caste
	networks will continue to smooth consumption in rural India for the
	foreseeable future, as they have for centuries, unless alternative
	consumption-smoothing mechanisms of comparable quality become available.},

	sentiment because people are wealthier or because they use movements
	in stock prices as an indicator of future economic activity and potential
	labor income growth? Using individual observations from the Michigan
	survey I found results more consistent with the view that people
	use movements in equity prices as a leading indicator. Although the

We exploit the unique, randomized timing of rebate receipt across households. Households spent 20 to 40 percent of their rebates on nondurable goods during the three-month period in which their rebates arrived, and roughly two-thirds of their rebates cumulatively during this period and the subsequent three-month period. The implied effects on aggregate consumption demand are substantial. Consistent with liquidity constraints, responses are larger for households with low liquid wealth or low income.

	payments (ESPs) disbursed in mid-2008, using special questions added
	to the Consumer Expenditure Survey and variation arising from the
	randomized timing of when the payments were disbursed. We find that,
	on average, households spent about 12-30% (depending on the specification)
	of their stimulus payments on non-durable expenditures during the
	three-month period in which the payments were received. Further,
	there was also a significant increase in spending on durable goods,
	in particular vehicles, bringing the average total spending response
	to about 50-90% of the payments. Relative to research on the 2001
	tax rebates, these spending responses are estimated with greater
	precision using the randomized timing variation. The estimated responses
	are substantial and significant for older, lower-income, and home-owning
	households. We further extend the literature in two ways. First,
	we find little evidence that the propensity to spend varies with
	the method of disbursement (paper check versus electronic transfer).
	Second, we evaluate a complementary methodology for quantifying the
	impact of tax cuts, which asks consumers to self-report whether they
	spent their tax cuts. The response of spending to the ESPs is indeed
	largest for self-reported spenders. However, self-reported savers
	also spent a significant fraction of the payments.},

	on Canada's potential GDP growth. Using a simple accounting framework
	to decompose trend GDP growth into changes in capital, labor services
	and total factor productivity, we find a sizeable drop in Canadian
	potential growth in the short term. The estimated decline of about
	1 percentage point originates from a sharply decelerating capital
	stock accumulation (as investment has dropped steeply) and a rising
	long-term unemployment rate (which would raise equilibrium unemployment
	rates). However, over the medium term, we expect Canada's potential
	GDP growth to gradually rise to around 2 percent, below the pre-crisis
	growth rate, mostly reflecting the effects of population aging and
	a secular decline in average working hours.},

	Abstract = {Stability of preferences is central to how economists study behavior.
	This paper uses panel data on hypothetical gambles over lifetime
	income in the Health and Retirement Study to quantify changes in
	risk tolerance over time and differences across individuals. The
	maximum-likelihood estimation of a correlated random effects model
	utilizes information from 12,000 respondents in the 1992-2002 HRS.
	The results are consistent with constant relative risk aversion and
	career selection based on preferences. While risk tolerance changes
	with age and macroeconomic conditions, persistent differences across
	individuals account for 73 percent of the systematic variation.},

	Abstract = {This article investigates the effects of stock market wealth on consumer
	spending. Traditional macroeconometric models estimate that a dollar's
	increase in stock wealth boosts consumption by three to seven cents.
	With the substantial 1990s rise in stock prices, the nature and magnitude
	of this {"}wealth effect{"} have been much debated. After describing
	the issues and previous research, I present new evidence from a well-known
	consumer survey. The results are broadly consistent with life-cycle
	saving and a modest wealth effect: most stockholders reported no
	appreciable effect of stock prices on their saving or spending, but
	many mentioned {"}retirement saving{"} in explaining their behavior.}}
