% Used for documents which can optionally be either 
%     - PDF documents with figures constructed from EPS files, or 
%     - HTM documents with PNG figures used directly
% Method is determined on-the-fly at runtime by 
% the setting of the option Web which should be set in the .cfg file used by htlatex
% The needed cfg file can be constructed by running the script ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/tex4htMakeCFG.sh

% Default is to make a PDF version
\provideboolean{PDFOut}\setboolean{PDFOut}{true}

\providecommand{\ifHTM}{\ifthenelse{\not{\boolean{PDFOut}}}}

% If called with option Web, don't make PDF version
\opt{Web}{\setboolean{PDFOut}{false}}

% Necessary because epstopdf requires pdftex but is not compatible with the dvi output option, which is needed for tex4ht
