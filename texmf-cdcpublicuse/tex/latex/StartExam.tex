I have written this exam in such a way that you can continue answering
later parts of each question even if you cannot answer the earlier
parts.  Substantial partial credit will be given in cases where you
understand the answer even if you cannot prove it mathematically.  On
the other hand, if I ask you to explain something, you will not get
full credit if you only provide math and no explanation of the
economics of a question.

Please WRITE YOUR ANSWERS ON THE EXAM; I have tried to provide more
than enough space for every question (note that there are some blank
pages after long questions); if you run out of room, use the back of
the preceding page.
