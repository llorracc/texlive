Thencheck the line of/CharStings 225 dict dup beginMath2-Bold.pfa has 223 glyph but the above line says thatMath2-Bold.pfa has 225 glyph.Next, open the disasmed Math2-Bold.pfa with a text editor and changeas following:/CharStrings 223 dict dup beginFinally, convert the human readable format to PFA with t1asm.Caution should be taken when you find /.notdef.  "/.notdef" isinvolved.The current version of dvipsk can handle the broken PFA fonts but theprevious version could not.  We got error messages of dvips.I know that Fontographer sometimes generate such wrong type 1 fonts.When I use TeXtrace to generate type 1 fonts from METAFONT file andread them with Fontographer to correct path and to add hinting, I gotType 1 fonts which had the wrong /CharStrings line.--Takanori Uchiyama, Ph.D.Dept.
