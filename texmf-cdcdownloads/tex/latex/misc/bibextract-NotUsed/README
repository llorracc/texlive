This directory, bibextract, contains UNIX shell and awk programs for
extracting citation tags from LaTeX source and .aux files, and for
using those tags to extract bibliography entries from a list of BibTeX
.bib files.

"make install" will install the programs citefind and citetags on your
system, together with their documentation.  Examine the BINDIR,
LIBDIR, MANDIR, and MANEXT settings in the Makefile carefully before
doing so; try "make -n install" to see what make would do without
actually doing it.

"make uninstall" will remove the programs and their documentation from
the system directories.

See the Makefile leading comments for other make targets.
