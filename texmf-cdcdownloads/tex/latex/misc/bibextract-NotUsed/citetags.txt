CITETAGS(1)              USER COMMANDS                CITETAGS(1)



NAME
     citetags - extract BibTeX citation tags from a LaTeX  source
     or .aux file

SYNOPSIS
     citetags LaTeX source or .aux file >tagsfile

DESCRIPTION
     citetags extracts BibTeX citation tags from a  LaTeX  source
     file  or  .aux  file  and sends them to stdout, possibly for
     later input to citefind(1).

     citetags and citefind(1) can be used to extract from a large
     BibTeX   bibliography  data  base  just  those  bibliography
     entries that are actually used  in  a  particular  document,
     perhaps  for  submission  to a publisher, or distribution in
     electronic form.

BUGS
     citetags is not smart enough  to  incorporate  BibTeX  cross
     references unless they are themselves cited.

     That feature should be added.
