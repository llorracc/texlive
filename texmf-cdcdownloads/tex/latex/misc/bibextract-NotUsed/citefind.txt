NAME
     citefind - extract matching bibliography entries from BibTeX
     .bib files

SYNOPSIS
     citefind tags-file bibfile(s) >newbibfile
     or
     citefind - bibfile(s) >newbibfile

DESCRIPTION
     citefind extracts from a list of  BibTeX  .bib  files  those
     bibliography entries that match a specified list of citation
     tags, possibly produced by citetags(1), sending the  entries
     to  stdout,  together with all BibTeX ``@Preamble{...}'' and
     ``@String{...}'' commands.

     If the first argument, tags-file, is ``-'', the tag list  is
     read from stdin, allowing it to be piped from citetags(1).

     Bibliography entries are output in the order  found  in  the
     .bib  files.  In the absence of cross references, you may be
     able to use bibsort(1) to sort them by citation key.   While
     such  sorting  is  unnecessary for BibTeX itself, it is con-
     venient for a human reader of the .bib file.

     When documents are prepared using a large bibliography  data
     base  collection,  it  is  sometimes convenient to extract a
     subset BibTeX bibliography  file  incorporating  only  those
     entries that are cited in the document.  A good example is a
     document to be submitted to a publisher, or  otherwise  dis-
     tributed in electronic form.

BUGS
     citefind is not smart enough  to  incorporate  BibTeX  cross
     references  unless  their  citation tags are included in the
     input list.

     No attempt is made to  reduce  the  output  ``@String{...}''
     commands to just those that are actually referenced.

     Those features should be added.
