NAME
     bibextract - extract BibTeX entries  from  a  list  of  .bib
     files

SYNOPSIS
     bibextract keyword-regexp value-regexp bibfile(s)

DESCRIPTION
     bibextract extracts from a list of BibTeX .bib  files  those
     bibliography  entries that match a pair of specified regular
     expressions, sending them to stdout, together with all  Bib-
     TeX ``@Preamble{...}'' and ``@String{...}'' commands.

     The first  regular-expression  pattern,  keyword-regexp,  is
     used to select which  ``keyword = "value"'' pairs to examine
     further; it matches against the keyword part only.  If it is
     an empty string, then all such pairs are examined.

     The second regular-expression pattern, value-regexp, is used
     to  further  select  from  the  value strings of ``keyword =
     "value"'' pairs the bibliography entries to be output.   The
     selection algorithm therefore consists of the logical AND of
     match successes against the keyword and value strings.

     bibextract can be  used  to  extract  from  a  large  BibTeX
     bibliography  data base just those bibliography entries that
     match a particular pair of regular expressions.

EXAMPLES
     Here are some examples:

     Extract all entries mentioning chaos in any field:

          bibextract "" "chaos" bibfile(s) >new-bibtex-file"

     Extract entries with  names  Brown  or  Smith  occurring  in
     either of the author or editor fields:

          bibextract  "author|editor"  "brown|smith"   bibfile(s)
          >new-bibtex-file

     Extract entries for titles containing the  letter  `z'  any-
     where  after  a vowel; note that single quotes are necessary
     to provide the necessary protection from shell expansion:

          bibextract  "title"   '[aeiou].*z'   bibfile(s)   >new-
          bibtex-file

BUGS
     bibextract is not smart enough to incorporate  BibTeX  cross
     references  unless they are themselves matched by the speci-
     fied regular expression.
