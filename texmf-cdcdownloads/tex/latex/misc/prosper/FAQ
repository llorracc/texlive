[1] Is it possible to switch Acrobat Reader in full screen mode on startup?

Yes. Just add 

\hypersetup{pdfpagemode=FullScreen}

in the preamble of your LaTeX file.



[2] How to use Type 1 fonts with MikTeX or teTeX?

For both MikTeX and teTeX, you have to add at least the two lines:

p +psfonts.cmz
p +psfonts.amz


For MikTeX:
-----------
Add the lines to the file \texmf\dvips\config\config.ps

For teTeX:
----------
Add the lines to the file ~/.dvipsrc (create it if it does not exist already)
